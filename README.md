# project_euler
Project Euler's (at projecteuler.net) entire mission is to bring interesting mathematically based computational problems to students, programmers, and others for the sheer challenge and fun of solving them. The problems are intended to be solved by way of computer programs. They span the gamut from easy to difficult, both mathematically and computationally. Once you've completed a problem, you have access to an active discussion board where you are able to post your solution and discuss it with others who have solved the same problem. Or simply review some of the other approaches that have been used to solve the same problem. Problems can be solved in any of the various common programming languages. 

Initially I intended to use this repository to store the coded solutions to the ProjectEuler.com problems I'd completed. But it has come to my attention, from deeper reading on the site, that the organizers request solutions not be posted on the Internet. As they explained it and I do agree: who am I to spoil someone elses "a ha" moment and the thrill of successfully solving an interesting problem. 

So instead, here you will not find the exact problems and solutions from ProjectEuler.com but rather extenstions, permutations, twists, or complications to these problems, with commentary and programmatic solutions. In this way, I plan to preserve the integrity of the problems on ProjectEuler.net. Welcome.
